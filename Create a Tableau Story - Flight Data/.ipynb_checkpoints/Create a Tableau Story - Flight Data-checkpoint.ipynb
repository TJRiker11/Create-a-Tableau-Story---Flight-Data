    "Airlines that report monthly numbers of flight delays to the BTS began reporting information on causes of delays in June 2003. The airlines report the causes of delays in five broad categories:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* **Air Carrier**: The cause of the cancellation or delay was due to circumstances within the airline's control (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    ">* **Extreme Weather**: Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* **National Aviation System (NAS)**: Delays and cancellations attributable to the national aviation system that refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* **Late-arriving aircraft**: A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight to depart late.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* **Security**: Delays or cancellations caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas."

    "\n",
    "> A flight is considered delayed when it arrived 15 or more minutes later than the scheduled time. Delayed minutes are calculated for delayed flights only. When multiple causes are assigned to one delayed flight, each cause is prorated based on the delayed minutes it is responsible for. The displayed numbers are rounded and may not add up to the total."

First, I put everything into a story presentation view so it would be easier to view and understand as the user clicks through the pages. I streched the graphs to get as much detail as possible on the page to see. Added and changed legends to explain more detail of the graphs. Changed the filters so one filter controls an entire page of charts, rather than one filer per chart. This was you can change the filter in one place, and it affects all graphs. Added more details to possibly explain certain outcomes, like more flights per carrier could equate to more delays etc. Added more details to maps and more map views. Added a percentage view to the late airlines data to show that some carriers have a higher or lower percentage of total late flights, no matter how many total flights they have. Added text data numbers for each data point explored, so along with the visualizations, there are also hard data numbers to reference and compare."

This order remains constant over all time periods of months and years. There is an increase in weather delays around winter months, December - February or so, but it is really not much of an increase and does not change the order of any types of delays. Late Aircraft delays are always the most common."
